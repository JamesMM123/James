<h1>Hangman</h1>
<p>The code print out a rope and a plank word. the code will show the amount of letters in the given word.  </p>
<p>The code will then ask you to guess a word and depending on your answer you could get it wrong or right. </p>
<p>if you guessed a correct letter the code will then put the letter you guessed where it is located in the word.</p>
<p>If you have guessed an incorrect letter you will lose one life and a part of the stickman will be drawn. </p>
<p>If all lives have five lives have been lost the game is over</p>
<p>After a correct letter is guess the code will then ask the user if they would like to guess a letter or guess the entire word.</p>
<p>If the word has been correctly guessed by the user then the game is over and the user wins</p>


<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>We used lists for words that the computer will choose</p>
<p>We used the random tool on our lists to select the word that will be used in game</p>
<p>we used functions to make the actual stick figure </p>
<p>We used While and if/else statements on the majority of the code. so if they put an incorrect answer and however many guess they needed. the if and else statements are used to interpret what the user inputs are? </p>
